# Prompt: People Module Competitor Analysis & Premium Implementation

## Competitor Influence
This implementation is inspired by market leaders in HR, workforce management, and global hiring:
- **BambooHR**: User-friendly self-service and clear "Employee Directory" visuals.
- **Rippling**: Unified "Employee Graph" and deeply integrated device/app management.
- **Workday**: Enterprise-grade "Job Profiles" and complex org structures.
- **Deel**: Global-first design, "Liquid" presence (remote/local), and compliance visualization.
- **Deputy**: Best-in-class rostering and shift visualization.

## Core Requirements for ATLVS People

### 1. The "Holographic" Directory (Rosters & Staff)
- **Liquid Cards**: Employee cards that feel like glass panes, showing real-time availability status (Online, On Leave, In Meeting).
- **Spatial Filters**: 3D-layered filtering for Department, Location, and Skillset.
- **Visual Org Chart**: An interactive, zoomable node graph showing reporting lines.

### 2. The "Life Stream" Profile (Profile & Performance)
- **Career Timeline**: A vertical "Spatial UI" timeline showing the employee's journey (Hired -> Promoted -> Awarded).
- **Skill DNA**: Radar charts or "Nebula" visualizations for skill proficiency and certifications.
- **360 Feedback**: Glass-morphic overlays for peer reviews and performance snapshots.

### 3. Smart Scheduling (Scheduling & Availability)
- **Drag-and-Drop Rostering**: A timeline view where shifts are translucent blocks that snap to users.
- **Conflict Heatmaps**: "Glow" effects on shifts that overlap with leave or fatigue rules.
- **Availability Grids**: A visual calendar showing "Green" (Available) vs "Grey" (Blocked) zones.

### 4. Global Mobility (Travel & Onboarding)
- **Travel Dashboard**: Map-based view of where staff are currently deployed (Deel-style world map).
- **Onboarding Tracks**: Progress bars with "Liquid" fill animation showing onboarding completion.

## UI/UX Standards
- **Aesthetic**: "Spatial UI" with deep Z-indexes for modal overlays (e.g., Profile popping out from the Directory).
- **Color Palette**:
    - **Status**: Emerald (Active), Amber (On Leave), Indigo (Remote), Rose (Terminated).
    - **Backgrounds**: Deep void darks with glass overlays.
- **Typography**: Clean, humanist sans-serif (Inter/Outfit) for high readability.
