## 6. Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations
1. **State Management**: Use React Query for server state, Zustand for UI state
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implement Supabase Realtime for live status updates
3. **Offline Support**: Service worker for time clock functionality
4. **Performance**: Virtual scrolling for large directories (1000+ employees)
5. **Security**: Row-level security for employee data access

### Migration Path
1. Phase 1: Add new tables without breaking existing functionality
2. Phase 2: Migrate existing data to enhanced schemas
3. Phase 3: Deploy new UI components alongside existing
4. Phase 4: Feature flag rollout to users
5. Phase 5: Deprecate legacy components

### Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| HR Admin Time/Week | Unknown | -40% |
| Employee Self-Service Adoption | 0% | 80% |
| Scheduling Time | Manual | -80% |
| Compliance Incidents | Unknown | 0 |
| Employee Satisfaction (eNPS) | Unknown | +20 |
